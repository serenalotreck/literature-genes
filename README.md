## OntoGPT
The script `knowledge_graph/run_ontoGPT.sh` can be used to run OntoGPT over a set of text files in a directory. The directions to set up the dependencies are found in the [OntoGPT repo](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ontogpt). In short, we cloned the repository, copied the `desiccation` schema from `knowledge_graph/schema` to `ontogpt/src/ontogpt/templates`, set up a conda environment with python 3.9 (separate from the one described in the main README of this repo) and used `pip install -e .` from the root directory of ontogpt to set up the package for our usage here.
